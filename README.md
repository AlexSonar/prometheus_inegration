<br />

## Intro & Project philosophy

The main idea was the decision **NOT to take a ready-made solution out of the box** in the form of a ready-made and pre-configured container.
Build your one on your side, but nevertheless do it fully automatic with the possibility of a wide custom configuration.
Or if you intended to make it quick and easy by running one entry-point file.

## Project structure

> Entry-point 
/docker/make_compose_component.sh

> The main executable file on the container side (autostarted)
/prometheus/installers/install_base_tools.sh

> Services test (autostarted)
/docker/services_availability_tests.sh

## Roadmap

Before you start please:

1. Take a look on roject prerequisites;
2. Take a look on [Docker-compose compatibility doc](https://github.com/AlexSonar/prometheus_inegration/blob/main/docs/issue_Docker-compose%20compatibility.md);
3. Take a look on /docker/set_env_vars_default.sh you may want to customize many of the variables like ports; environment; labels networks; ext.
(**Caution!** the "volumes" has an inverse relationship in the project components)
4. run /docker/make_compose_component.sh

<br />

## Running tests
The theme contains a minimal test suite.
